# Spatial Machine Learning & Advanced Regression

## Building model

See week 6 in class code

## Part 1: Expanding Reg Toolkit

**Interaction Effects**
The Question

- Does the effect of one variable depend on the level of another variable?
  - i.e. Does sq footage matter more in wealthier neighboorhoods

Polynomial Terms: Non-Linear Relationships

- When straight lines don't fit
  - Signs of Non-Linearity:
    -Curved residual plots
    - Diminishing returns
    - Accelerating effects
    - U-shaped or inverted-U patterns
    - Theoretical reasons

## Incorporating Geography

**Tobler's First Law of Geography**:
“Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”
