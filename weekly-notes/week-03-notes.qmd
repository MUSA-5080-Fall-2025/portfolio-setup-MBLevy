# Data Visualization & Exploratory Analysis

## Part 1: Why Visualization Matters

**Anscombe's Quartet: The Famous Example**
- Four datasets with identical summary statistics:
  - Same means, variances, correlation, and regression line
  -Completely different patterns when [visualized](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=anscombe%27s+quartet&iar=images&t=newext&atb=v414-1)

**The Policy Implications**
Why this matters for your work:

- Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
- Outliers may represent important communities
- Relationships aren't always linear
- Visual inspection reveals data quality issues
- I.e. an average of two extremes within a population may look like an area has average value

Ethical Data Communication

- Only *27% of planners* warn users about unreliable ACS data — most don't reort MoE — many lack training on statistical uncertainty
  - **This violates AICP code of ethics**
- Your responsibility:
  - Create honest, transparent visualizations
  - Always assess and communicate data quality
  - Consider who might be harmed by uncertain data


Bad Visualizations Have Real Consequences

- Common problems in government data presentation:
  - Misleading scales or axes
  - Cherry-picked time periods
  - Hidden or ignored uncertainty
  - Missing context about data reliability
- **Real impact:** The Jurjevich et al. study found that *72% of Portland census tracts* had unreliable child poverty estimates, yet planners rarely communicated this uncertainty.
- **Result:** Poor policy decisions based on misunderstood data


## Part 2: Grammar of Graphics

**The ggplot2 Philosophy**

- Grammar of Graphics principles:
  - Data -> Aesthetics -> Geometries -> Visual
    - Data: your dataset
    - Aesthetics: what variables map to visual properties
    - Geometries: how to display the data (points, bars, lines, etc.)
    - Additional layers: scales, themes, facets, annotations, etc.
- Structure:
  - `ggplot(data = dataset) + aes(x = var1, y = var2) + geom_something() + additional_layers()`

Aesthetic Mappings: The Key to `ggplot2`

- Aesthetics map data to visual properties
  - `x,y`: position
  - `color`: point/line color
  - `fill`: area fill color
  - `size`: point shape
  - `alpha`: transparency
  - **Note**: constants go outside `aes()`


## Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA Mindset:
*The goal is to understand your data before making decisions or building models*

1. What does the data look like? (distributions, missing values, etc.)
2. What patterns exist? (relationships, clusters, trends)
3. What's unusual? (outliers, anomalies, data quality)
4. What questions does this raise? (hypotheses for further investigation)
5. How reliable is this data?


**EDA Workflow with Data Quality Focus**
Enhanced process for policy analysis:

1. Load and inspect - dimensions, variable types, missing data
2. Assess reliability - examine margins of error, calculate coefficients of variation
3. Visualize distributions - histograms, boxplots for each variable
4. Explore relationships - scatter plots, correlations
5. Identify patterns - grouping, clustering, geographical patterns
6. Question anomalies - investigate outliers and unusual patterns
7. Document limitations - prepare honest communication about data quality
