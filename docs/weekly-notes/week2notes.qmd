# Algorithmic Decision Making & Census Data

## Part 1: Algorithmic Decision Making

### What is an Algorithm?

**Def**: A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem/completing a task

### Algorithm Decision Making in Gov

  - Systems used to assist or replace human decision-makers
    - Based on predictions from models that process historical data containing:
      - Inputs: features, predictors, ind. variables, x, etc.
      - Outputs: labels, outcomes, dep. variables, y, etc.
  - Read World Ex: Mortgage lending and tenant screening algorithms
  
Clarifying Key Terms

  - **Data Science**: Computer science/engineering focus on algorithms and methods
  - **Data Analytics**: Application of data science methods to other disciplines
  - **Machine Learning**: Algorithms for classification & prediction that learn from data
  - **AI**: Algorithms that adjust and improve across iterations
  
### Public Sector Context

Long history of government data collection:

  - Civic registration systems
  - Census data
  - Administrative records
  - Operations research (post-WW2)

What's new?

  - More data (official and "accidental")
  - Focus on *prediction* rather than explanation
  - *Harder to interpret* and explain

Why Gov Uses Algorithms

  - Governments have limited budgets and need to serve everyone
  - Algorithmic decision making is especially appealing bc it **wrongly** promises:
    - Efficiency: produces cases faster
    - Consistency: same rules applied to everyone 
    - Objectivity: removes human bias
    - Cost savings: fewer staff needed (labor is expensive!!)

### When Algorithms Go Wrong

Data Analytics is subjective!

  - Every step involves human choice
    - Data cleaning decisions
    - Data coding/classifications
    - Data collection (use of imperfect proxies)
    - Result interpretations
    - Variables chosen to be put in the model
  - Human values and biases are embedded!

Bias is everywhere!

  - Healthcare algorithms have systematically discriminated against Black patients
   - Algorithms used healthcare costs as a proxy for need
    - Black patients typically incur lower costs due to systemic inequities in access
    - Resulted in the under-prioritization of Black patients despite equivalent levels of illness
  - Criminal Justice algorithms use biased (***racist***) policing data

## Part 3: Census Data Foundations

### Why Census Data Matters

**Census Data is the foundations for**

  - Understanding community demos
  - Allocating government resources
  - Tracking neighborhood change
  - Designing "fair" algorithms
  
**Connection**: The same demo data used in the census goes into many of the algorithms we analyzed

Census vs American Community Survey (ACS)

  - Decennial Census
    - Everyone counted
    - 9 basic questions (age, race, sex, housing)
    - Constitutional requirement
    - Determines apportionment
  - ACS
    - 3% of households analyzed annually
    - Detailed questions (income, education, employment, housing costs)
    - Replaced the old "long form census" in 2005

ACS Estimates
  - 1 year estimates (areas > 65,000 ppl)
    - Most current data, too small of sample for most use
  - 5 year estimate (all areas)
    - Most reliable data, large sample
    - What we use most often 
  - **Key Point**: All ACS data comes with *margins of error*

Most policy analysis occurs at county, census tract, and block groups levels 

2020 Census Innovation: Differential Privacy

  - The Challenge: Modern computing can re-identify individuals from census data
  - The Solutions: Add mathematical "noise" to protect privacy whilst preserving patterns
  - The Controversy: Some places now show pops living underwater or in other impossible places
  - Why this matters: Even "objective" data involves subjective choices abt privacy v accuracy
    - Also errors

### Accessing Census Data in R

We will use the `tidycensus` package

Census data structure is as follows:
  - Data organized into tables
    - i.e. B19013: Median Household Income
  - Each table has multiple variables
    - B19013_001E: Median household income (estimate)
    - B19013_001M: Median household incomee (margin of errro)

Working with margins of error

  - Every ACS estimate comes with uncertainty
    - Large MOE relative to estimate = less reliable
    - Small MOE relative to estimate = more reliable
  - In analysis:
    - Always report MOE alongside estimates
    - Be cautious comparing estimates with overlapping error margins
    - Consider using 5year estimates for greater reliability

Two types of Census Data

  - Summary Tables (what we'll mostly use)
    - Precalc statistics by geo
    - Good for mapping, geo comparison
  - PUMS - individual records
    - anonymous individual/HH responses
    - Good for custom analysis, regression models

Data sources

  - TIGER/Line Files
    - geographic boundaries (.shp)
  - Historical Data Sources
    - [NHGIS](nhgis.org): Historical census data
    -Neighborhood Change Database
    -Longitudinal Tract Database: track changes over time

## Part 4: Hands on Use

![get_acs](imgNotes/getACS.png)

Output

  - `GEOID`: Geo identifier
  - `NAME`: Human-readable location name
  - `variable`: Census variable code
  - `estimate`: Actual value
  - `moe`: Margin of error
